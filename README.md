# Image Processing Site
### This website allows you to upload a background and a foreground image, blend them using alpha blending, and apply various filters such as grayscale, sepia, saturate, and invert. You can also adjust brightness and contrast, apply effects like smooth, sharpen, gradient, and Laplacian on the background image, and download or reset the canvas. Use the sliders and radio buttons to modify the image, and click the 'Save' button to download the final result.
