## 📌 Overview

This interactive web application lets users perform **real-time image processing operations** directly in the browser. Users can upload **background and foreground images**, apply various filters and effects, adjust visual properties, blend images with alpha blending, and finally download the result.

This project was developed as part of the **Computer Graphics (CS360)** course, focusing on shader-based image manipulation using **WebGL** and **JavaScript**.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Upload background & foreground images  
- ✅ Alpha blending of images  
- 🎨 Apply artistic filters:  
  - Grayscale  
  - Sepia  
  - Saturate  
  - Invert  
- 🌗 Adjust image properties:  
  - Brightness  
  - Contrast  
- 🧠 Perform image processing on **background image** only:  
  - Smooth  
  - Sharpen  
  - Gradient  
  - Laplacian  
- 💾 Save canvas output  
- 🔄 Reset filters or entire canvas  

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. Upload a **background image**.  
2. Optionally upload a **foreground image** and choose **Alpha Blended** mode.  
3. Use the radio buttons to apply filters or processing techniques.  
4. Adjust sliders for **brightness** and **contrast**.  
5. Click **Save** to download your final image or **Reset** to start over.
